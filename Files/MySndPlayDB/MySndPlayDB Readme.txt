MySndPlayDB was written to try to be a Carbon compatible replacement for SndPlayDoubleBuffer.This is not as easy as I had hoped.  It requires that I walk the sound channel's data, which should be OK since you can allocate the sound channel memory yourself.  There are no accessorsto get at the sound channel structure, so hopefully this will be OK.This also requires that I have a wrapper around SndDoImmediate for any quietCmd that is issued.Also, with Sound Manager 3.4 and 3.5, to make the beginning of the sound glitch free would requirethat the library implement tripple buffering (making one more copy of the buffers passed bythe users fill routine).  I don't have the time to implement such a scheme at this point, thoughit should not be too hard to do.  This sample works just fine with Sound Manager 3.6 and 3.3.  Thereason it doesn't work with 3.4 and 3.5 is that they implement a double buffering scheme in theApple Mixer that causes code to think that it has finished playing a sound (and therefore reusea buffer) before the sound has actually finished playing.The code is heavily commented, at least I think so, so it should be pretty easy to follow thecode and figure out what's going on.Good luck.
