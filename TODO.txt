Please note that this code is still in Beta, in that many parts of the code
doesn't work as expected or desired.

* There isn't a Window menu.
* The localization Rez files are outdated and thus disabled.
* Hardware MIDI support needs to use CoreMIDI on OS X.
* Printing needs to be re-written.
* The windows don't support a scroll wheel.  Need to look into why.
* The banner on the source files needs to be updated.
* the code can probably be done in a cleaner way via C++ instead of 
    plain C.

Also note that there are TODOs scattered across the source files.

The following todos will be done in the main branch:

* The VST and Visual Plug-in architectures for Mac OS X needs to be re-written.
* Linux support is currently a stub.
* Make a Linux Makefile, maybe by using a configure script?
