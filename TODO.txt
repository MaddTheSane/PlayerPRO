Please note that this code is still in Beta, in that many parts of the code
doesn't work as expected or desired.

* COCOA PLAYERPRO NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN!
* The VST and Visual Plug-in architectures for Mac OS X needs to be updated.
* Hardware MIDI support needs to use CoreMIDI on OS X.
* The banner on the source files needs to be updated.
* Linux support is currently a stub.
* The Linux Makefile is bare-bones.

Also note that there are TODOs scattered across the source files.
