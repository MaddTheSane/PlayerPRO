Please note that this code is still in Beta, in that many parts of the code
doesn't work as expected or desired.

* COCOA PLAYERPRO NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN!
* The VST and Visual Plug-in architectures for Mac OS X needs to be updated.
* Hardware MIDI support needs to use CoreMIDI on OS X.
* Maybe use OS X VSTs and Audio Unit Plugins?
* Plug-ins need to be checked for places to byteswap. AMF and the old MAD plug 
    importers are those I know need this.
* Determine if a file is openable by determining its UTI, not its old Mac OS 9
    filetype. Mac OS X doesn't write a file's filetype based on extension on OS 
    X.
* The file icons need to be redrawn: they're still 8-bit color and 32*32.
* The banner on the source files needs to be updated.
* Linux support is currently a stub.
* The Linux Makefile is bare-bones and the plug-ins aren't being built.

Also note that there are TODOs scattered across the source files.
