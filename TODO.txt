Please note that this code is still in Beta, in that many parts of the code
doesn't work as expected or desired.

* There isn't a Window or a Help menu.
* The localization Rez files and the app-wide Rez files have multiply defined
    resources.
* The localization Rez files are outdated and are disabled.
* The Plug-in architecture(s) for Mac OS X needs to be re-written.
* CoreAudio Output is currently a stub.
* Hardware MIDI support needs to use CoreMIDI on OS X.
* Printing needs to be re-written.
* It would be great if PlayerPROCore was 64-bit.
* Migrate away from QuickDraw. Maybe use Carbon NIBs? Or port GUI to Cocoa?
* Maybe use OS X VSTs and Audio Unit Plugins?
* Make a MODList that stores file references as Aliases.
* The windows don't support a scroll wheel.  Need to look into why.
* Plug-ins need to be checked for places to byteswap. AMF and the old MAD plug importers
    are two I know need this.
* Determine if a file is openable by determining its UTI.
* The file icons need to be redrawn: they're still 8-bit color and 32*32.

Also note that there are TODOs scattered accross the source files.
