Please note that this code is still in Beta, in that many parts of the code
doesn't work as expected or desired.

* There isn't a Window menu.
* The localization Rez files and the app-wide Rez files have multiply defined
    resources.
* The localization Rez files are outdated and are disabled.
* The VST and Visual Plug-in architectures for Mac OS X needs to be re-written.
* Hardware MIDI support needs to use CoreMIDI on OS X.
* Printing needs to be re-written.
* It would be great if PlayerPROCore was 64-bit.
* Migrate away from QuickDraw. Maybe use Carbon NIBs? Or port GUI to Cocoa?
* Maybe use OS X VSTs and Audio Unit Plugins?
* Make a MODList that stores file references as Aliases and not paths.
* The windows don't support a scroll wheel.  Need to look into why.
* Determine if a file is openable by determining its UTI, not its old Mac OS 9
    filetype. Mac OS X doesn't write a file's filetype based on extension on OS 
    X.
* The banner on the source files needs to be updated.
* Linux support is currently a stub.
* Make a Linux Makefile, maybe by using a configure script?

Also note that there are TODOs scattered across the source files.
