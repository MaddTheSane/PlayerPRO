/* 		This is a basic win32 DLL.	Although not required, this DLL has a DllMain() entry/exit function, which is used when	any per-process or per-thread initialization (such as memory allocation/release) has to	be performed.		Exporting DLL functions is accomplished here with the use of the __declspec(dllexport)	storage class specifier; this prompts the linker to generate a stub file with a .dll.lib	extension that must be included in the project for the application that uses the DLL.		Importing the functions in the DLL's host application is accomplished by simply declaring	them as extern, or with the __declspec(dllimport) storage class specifier (The latter 	method is preferred, since it allows slightly more efficient code to be produced.	(More information on DLL's can be found in "Advanced Windows: The Developer's Guide	to the Win32 API for Windows NT 3.5 and Windows 95", by Jeffrey Richter and "Programming	Windows 95", by Charles Petzold)		Lucien S.	Metrowerks Tech.
