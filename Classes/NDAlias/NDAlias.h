	@class NDAlias
	@abstract A class to access the Alias Manager from Cocoa.
	@discussion Your application can use an <tt>NDAlias</tt> to refer to file system objects (that is, files, directories, and volumes) in a way that does expect the file system object's path to be maintained. The user then can move or rename the file system object without your program losing track of it. This behaviour is not always desirable, for instance with library resources. But for file system objects like documents or user folders, it is what Mac OS users have come to expect.
